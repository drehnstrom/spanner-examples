# Choosing Primary Keys

## Overview

In this lab, you examine and run the Python code for generating Spanner primary keys in various formats. 

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:
* Generate Spanner primary keys as UUIDs.
* Convert counters and timestamps into values appropriate for Spanner primary keys.

## Task 1. Programming Spanner databases with Python
1. Navigate to DataFlow Workbench and click the __New Notebook__ button on the menu bar.

2. Choose Apache Beam Without GPUs. Name the notebook "notebook", choose the us-central1 region, and leave all the other defaults and click the create button. Wait a few minutes for the VM to complete and refresh if needed.

3. Click on the __Open Jupyter__ link and it will bring you into the Jupyter interface. From the menu choose __Git__ and __Clone Repository__ and enter the following URL https://github.com/drehnstrom/spanner-examples.git   

4. Navigate to /spanner-examples/colab-notebooks/Spanner_Generating_PK_Values.ipynb and open that file. 

5. This is a Jupyter notebook with the Python code for generating primary keys in various formats using Python. Read the text and run the code in each code cell. To run the code, click the icon on the tool bar that looks like a triangle (the sixth from the left). 

### **Congratulations!** You have examined and run the Python code for generating Spanner primary keys in various formats.
