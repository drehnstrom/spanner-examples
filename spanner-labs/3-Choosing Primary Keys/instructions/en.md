# Choosing Primary Keys

## Overview

In this lab, you will examine and run the Python code for generating Spanner primary keys in various formats. 

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:
* Generate Spanner primary keys as UUIDs
* Convert counters and timestamps into values appropriate for Spanner primary keys

## Task 1. Programming Spanner databases with Python

1. Go to the following URL: https://github.com/drehnstrom/spanner-examples/blob/main/colab-notebooks/Spanner_Generating_PK_Values.ipynb 

2. This is a Jupyter notebook with the Python code for gnerating primary keys in various formats using Python. Click on the __Open in Colab__ icon ![colab icon](img/colab-icon.png). <div>This will open the notebook in an online Jupyter environment provided by Google. </div>

3. Read the text and run the code in each code cell. To run the code, hover over the code cell and a __Run__ button will appear. Click on the button. 

__Note:__ You will get a warning on the first cell informing you that the notebook was not created by Google. Choose to run the notebook anyway. 

### **Congratulations!** You have examined and ran the Python code for generating Spanner primary keys in various formats.
