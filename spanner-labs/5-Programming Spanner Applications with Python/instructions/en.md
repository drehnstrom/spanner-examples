# Programming Spanner Applications with Python

## Overview

In this lab, you run the Python code to create Spanner instances and databases. You also see how to create, retrieve, and delete records from databases using both the Google Standard SQL and PostgreSQL dialects. 

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:
* Use Python to create and delete Spanner instances and databases.
* Program Spanner databases that use the PostgreSQL dialect.

## Setup and Requirements

## Task 1. Programming Spanner databases with Python

1. From your Qwiklabs lab instructions, make note of your username, password, and Google Cloud project ID. You will need these later. 

2. If you don't already have a DataFlow Workbench VM up and running, repeat the steps from Lab 3 to create one and clone the github project at the following URL: https://github.com/drehnstrom/spanner-examples.git

3. Open /spanner-examples/colab-notebooks/Spanner_Samples_Python.ipynb and open it. This is a Jupyter notebook with the Python code for creating and using Spanner instances and databases. 

4. Run the first cell to install the Python Spanner client library. 

5. In the second cell, change the `project_id` variable to your Qwiklabs project ID, and then run the cell. 

8. Read the text prior to each code cell and run each one. Take the time to understand what the code is doing. 

## Task 2. Programming Spanner databases using the PostgreSQL dialect

1. Open /spanner-examples/colab-notebooks/Spanner_PostgeSQL.ipynb.

2. Examine and run each of the steps in the notebook.

### **Congratulations!** You have run the Python code to create Spanner instances and databases. You also saw how to create, retrieve, and delete records from databases using both the Google Standard SQL and PostgreSQL dialects.
